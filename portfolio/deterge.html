      <h6 class="docs-header topic">Background</h6>
      <p>Back in 2015, there was a lack of proper doorstep laundry service in Bhubaneswar area and the ones who had that service weren't economical for college students.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="docs-section" id="intro">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Solution</h6>
      <p>We came up with solution to provide an affordable online laundry service for everyone specifically targeting to students.</p>

    <div class="docs-section" id="intro">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Research</h6>
      <p>User research was done of more than 100 potential target users from different colleges around the area.<br>Results of the research were that most of the users cared about only booking feature. Lot of them don't like the hassle of registering and
        wanted easy signing up process. To view the survey form responses, click <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

          <img class="full-width-image"src="../images/portfolio/deterge/survey.png" alt="">
        </div>
      <p>Based on my research, we were able to validate the concept and also identify key user stories to aid me in designing the interface. With a good understanding of the user needs, I prioritised the functionalities and created user flows for the app.</p>

    <!-- Ideation -->
    <div class="docs-section" id="intro">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Ideation</h6>
      <p>So based on research we found out that the main purpose of the app was to request for laundry pickup. We decided to avoid registration or login as the first interaction of the app, so we kept the first screen to be the main function of the app,
        that is to request for laundry pickup.</p>
        <div class="container full-width-image">
          <img class="full-width-image"src="../images/portfolio/deterge/userflow.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>At this point we've dealed with UX stage and moved on to designing stage. In this project the key part was exclusively based on designing, since the architecture of the app was pretty clear; it was all about the details in UI and interaction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="docs-section" id="intro">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Design</h6>
      <p>I did some initial sketching on paper with pencil and pen. After some review and iteration, used XD to create detailed wireframes. The key here was to design, review and iterate until we had a smooth user experience. Google’s Material design with
        little bit touch of our own that looks well in both Android as well as iOS was used as the guideline to create a slick, modern UI.</p>
        <div class="container full-width-image">
          <img class="full-width-image"src="../images/portfolio/deterge/sketching.png" alt="">
        </div>
      <p>I used the Adobe XD to design the interface of the app. With symbols and text styles, it was easy to iterate the design and integrate user and client feedback. For user testing, I uploaded the preview on Adobe XD Live Preview From observation and
        their feedback, I re-iterated the design.</p>
        <div class="container full-width-image">
          <img class="full-width-image"src="../images/portfolio/deterge/wireframe1.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="section charts-hero">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="one-half column">
              <img class="charts" src="../images/portfolio/deterge/wireframe2.png">
            </div>
            <div class="one-half column">
              <img class="charts" src="../images/portfolio/deterge/wireframe3.png">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The designs initially were quite subtle and followed the usual practices of laundry apps that were there in the market. But we eventually decided to strip down steps that weren't needed and make it an easier experience. We thought we don't have the first step to be the login or register screen, then the user can directly jump to the purpose that he/she is there in the app.</p>
        <div class="container full-width-image">
          <img class="full-width-image"src="../images/portfolio/deterge/iteration.png" alt="">

    </div>
    <div class="docs-section" id="intro">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Branding</h6>
      <p>We got inspired by minimal text logos like that of Uber and Google which is easily identifiable without going through much graphic designing for the logo. Blue being indicative of colour we decided it to be our primary colour. I used Adobe Illustrator to design icons and logo. <br>As a part of laundry service's user experience, the laundered clothes were packed in a reusable tote bag with personalised tag.</p>
